    "\n",
    "**Sequence-­to-Ssequence** (S2S) models are a special case of a general family of models called encoder–decoder models which are made of an encoder and a decoder, both of which are simultaneously trained. The encoder captures important properties of the input with respect to the task at hand and the decoder takes the encoded input to produce a desired output. The encoder–decoder model is a general framework for many tasks, including machine translation, image captioning, and text summarization. \n"
